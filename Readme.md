This is the contract I developed to test my Smart Contracts developed on the IERC20 interface.

The code is developed on Solidity. Can be tested using local EVM or Hardhat.

Key features:-

Contains a router to route the DEX buys
Added Liquidity Function
Added Swap
Added Swap route
Added Swap deadline
Added Address route
Optimized for security
Efficient and easy LP Pair checks
Uses V2


=========================================================================


Uses the IERC20 Contracts to initialise the instance of that particular token and call onto the specified functions

Usage:

Deploy it on Ropsten/Mainnet(IF WILLING TO TEST IT OUT LIVE)
Make sure the deployer has enough ETH
Deploy the BuyTech on the chain, RPC of your choice, works with any EVM compatible chains
Fund the BuyTech
Enter the required parameters
Call the functions

>>Optimized for Polygon(Advantageous)


Beneficial prospects:

Can also be integrated with WEB3 Dapp to faciliate testing on the UI side.
